  [33X[0;0Y[5XCoReLG[105X  (Computing with Real Lie Groups) is a [5XGAP[105X package for computing with
  (semi-)simple real Lie algebras. Various capabilities of the package have to
  do  with  the action of the adjoint group of a real Lie algebra (such as the
  nilpotent  orbits, and non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras). CoReLG is also the
  acronym of the EU funded Marie Curie project carried out by the first author
  of the package at the University of Trento.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  simple  real Lie algebras have been classified, and this classification
  is  the main theoretical tool that we use, as it determines the objects that
  we work with. In Section [14X1.1[114X we give a brief account of this classification.
  We  refer  to  the  standard  works in the literature (e.g., [Kna02]) for an
  in-depth  discussion. The algorithms of this package are described in [DG13]
  and [DFG13].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe remark that the package still is under development, and its functionality
  is continuously extended. The package [5XSLA[105X, [Gra12], is required.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe simple real Lie algebras[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  denote  a  complex  simple Lie algebra. Then there are two
  types   of   simple   real  Lie  algebras  associated  to  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X:  the
  [13Xrealification[113X  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  (this means that [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X is viewed as an
  algebra over [22XR[122X, of dimension [22X2dim mathfrakg^c[122X), and the [13Xreal forms[113X [22Xmathfrakg[122X
  of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X (this means that [22XmathfrakgâŠ—_RC[122X is isomorphic to [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X).
  It  is  straightforward to construct the realification of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X; so in
  the rest of this section we concentrate on the real forms of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  Lie  algebra  is  said  to  be  [13Xcompact[113X  if  its Killing form is negative
  definite.   The  complex  Lie  algebra  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  has  a  unique  (up  to
  isomorphism)  compact  real form [22Xmathfraku[122X. In the sequel we fix the compact
  form  [22Xmathfraku[122X. Then [22Xmathfrakg^c = mathfraku + imath mathfraku[122X, where [22Ximath[122X
  is  the  complex  unit;  so  we  get  an  antilinear  map  [22XÏ„ : mathfrakg^c->
  mathfrakg^c[122X  by  [22XÏ„(x+  imath  y) = x- imath y[122X, where [22Xx,yâˆˆ mathfraku[122X. This is
  called the [13Xconjugation[113X of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X with respect to [22Xmathfraku[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22XÎ¸[122X  be an automorphism of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X of order 2, commuting with [22XÏ„[122X.
  Then  [22XÎ¸[122X  stabilises  [22Xmathfraku[122X,  so  the  latter  is the direct sum of the [22XÂ±
  1[122X-eigenspaces  of  [22XÎ¸[122X,  say  [22Xmathfraku  =  mathfraku_1  âŠ•  mathfraku_-1[122X.  Set
  [22Xmathfrakk  =  mathfraku_1[122X  and  [22Xmathfrakp  =  imathfraku_-1[122X.  Then [22Xmathfrakg
  =mathfrakg(Î¸)=  mathfrakk  âŠ•  mathfrakp[122X  is  a  real  form  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.
  Regarding this construction we remark the following:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[22Xmathfrakg  = mathfrakkâŠ• mathfrakp[122X is called a [13XCartan decomposition[113X. It
        is unique up to inner automorphisms of [22Xmathfrakg[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  map [22XÎ¸[122X is a [13XCartan involution[113X; it is the identity on [22Xmathfrakk[122X and
        acts as multiplication by [22X-1[122X on [22Xmathfrakp[122X)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[22Xmathfrakk[122X  is  compact,  and  it  is  a  maximal compact subalgebra of
        [22Xmathfrakg[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YTwo  real forms are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding Cartan
        involutions are conjugate in the automorphism group of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe automorphism [22XÎ¸[122X is described by two pieces of data: a list of signs
        [22X(s_1,...,s_r)[122X  of  length  equal  to  the  rank  [22Xr[122X of [22Xmathfrakg[122X, and a
        permutation  [22XÏ€[122X  of  [22X1,..., r[122X, leaving the list of signs invariant. Let
        [22XÎ±_1,..., Î±_r[122X denote the simple roots of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X with corresponding
        canonical generators [22Xx_i, y_i, h_i[122X. Then [22XÎ¸(x_i) = s_i x_Ï€(i)[122X, [22XÎ¸(y_i) =
        s_i y_Ï€(i)[122X, [22XÎ¸(h_i) = h_Ï€(i)[122X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YCartan subalgebras and more[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  be  a real form of the complex Lie algebra [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X, with
  Cartan  decomposition  [22Xmathfrakg = mathfrakkâŠ• mathfrakp[122X. A Cartan subalgebra
  [22Xmathfrakh[122X   of   [22Xmathfrakg[122X   is   [13Xstandard[113X  (with  respect  to  this  Cartan
  decomposition) if [22Xmathfrakh = (mathfrakhâˆ© mathfrakk)âŠ• (mathfrakhâˆ©mathfrakp)[122X,
  or, equivalently, when [22Xmathfrakh[122X is stable under the Cartan involution [22XÎ¸[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  a  fact that every Cartan subalgebra of [22Xmathfrakg[122X is conjugate by an
  inner  automorphism to a standard one ([Kna02], Proposition 6.59). Moreover,
  there  is  a  finite number of non-conjugate (by inner automorphisms) Cartan
  subalgebras  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  ([Kna02],  Proposition  6.64). A standard Cartan
  subalgebra  [22Xmathfrakh[122X  is  said  to be [13Xmaximally compact[113X if the dimension of
  [22Xmathfrakhâˆ©  mathfrakk[122X is maximal (among all standard Cartan subalgebras). It
  is  called [13Xmaximally non-compact[113X if the dimension of [22Xmathfrakhâˆ© mathfrakp[122X is
  maximal. We have that all maximally compact Cartan subalgebras are conjugate
  via  the  inner  automorphism  group.  The  same  holds  for  all  maximally
  non-compact Cartan subalgebras ([Kna02], Proposition 6.61).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  subspace  of  [22Xmathfrakp[122X is said to be a [13XCartan subspace[113X if it consists of
  commuting  elements. If [22Xmathfrakh[122X is a maximally non-compact standard Cartan
  subalgebra,  then [22Xmathfrakc = mathfrakhâˆ© mathfrakp[122X is a Cartan subspace. The
  other  Cartan subalgebras (i.e., representatives of the conjugacy classes of
  the   Cartan   subalgebras  under  the  inner  automorphism  group)  can  be
  constructed  such  that  their  intersection  with [22Xmathfrakp[122X is contained in
  [22Xmathfrakc[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEvery   standard   Cartan   subalgebra   [22Xmathfrakh[122X  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  yields  a
  corresponding  root  system [22XÎ¦[122X of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X. Let [22XÎ±âˆˆÎ¦[122X, then a short argument
  shows  that  [22XÎ±âˆ˜Î¸[122X  (where  [22XÎ±âˆ˜Î¸ (h) = Î±(Î¸(h))[122X for [22Xhâˆˆ mathfrakh[122X) is also a root
  (i.e.,  lies  in  [22XÎ¦[122X). This way we get an automorphism of order 2 of the root
  system [22XÎ¦[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22Xmathfrakh[122X  be  a  maximally  compact standard Cartan subalgebra of
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X, with root system [22XÎ¦[122X. Then it can be shown that there is a basis of
  simple  roots  [22Xâˆ†âŠ‚Î¦[122X  which  is  [22XÎ¸[122X-stable.  Write  [22Xâˆ†  = {Î±_1,...,Î±_r}[122X, and let
  [22Xx_i,y_i,h_i[122X  be a corresponding set of canonical generators. Then there is a
  sequence  of  signs  [22X(s_1,...,s_r)[122X  and a permutation [22XÏ€[122X of [22X1,...,r[122X such that
  [22XÎ¸(x_i) = s_i x_Ï€(i)[122X. Now we encode this information in the Dynkin diagram of
  [22XÎ¦[122X.  If  [22Xs_i=-1[122X  then  we paint the node corresponding to [22XÎ±_i[122X black. Also, if
  [22XÏ€(i)=j  â‰   i[122X  then  the  nodes corresponding to [22XÎ±_i[122X, [22XÎ±_j[122X are connected by an
  arrow.  The  resulting  diagram  is  called a [13XVogan diagram[113X of [22Xmathfrakg[122X. It
  determines  the real form [22Xmathfrakg[122X up to isomorphism. The signs [22Xs_i[122X are not
  uniquely  determined. However, it is possible to make a ``canonical'' choice
  for the signs so that the Vogan diagram is uniquely determined.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22Xmathfrakh[122X be a maximally non-compact standard Cartan subalgebra of
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X, with root system [22XÎ¦[122X. Then, in general, there is no basis of simple
  roots which is stable under [22XÎ¸[122X. However we can still define a diagram, in the
  following  way.  Let [22Xmathfrakc = mathfrakhâˆ© mathfrakp[122X be the Cartan subspace
  contained  in [22Xmathfrakh[122X. Let [22XÎ¦_c = { Î±âˆˆ Î¦ âˆ£ Î±âˆ˜Î¸ = Î±} = { Î±âˆˆ Î¦ âˆ£ Î±(mathfrakc)
  =  0}[122X be the set of [13Xcompact roots [113X. Then there is a choice of positive roots
  [22XÎ¦^+[122X  such  that  [22XÎ±âˆ˜Î¸  âˆˆ Î¦^-[122X for all [13Xnon-compact[113X positive roots [22XÎ±âˆˆ Î¦^+[122X. Let [22Xâˆ†[122X
  denote  the  basis  of  simple  roots corresponding to [22XÎ¦^+[122X. A theorem due to
  Satake  says  that  there  is a bijection [22XÏ„ : âˆ†-> âˆ†[122X such that [22XÏ„(Î±) = Î±[122X if [22XÎ±âˆˆ
  Î¦_c[122X,  and  for  non-compact [22XÎ±âˆˆâˆ†[122X we have [22XÎ±âˆ˜Î¸ = -Ï„(Î±) - âˆ‘_Î³âˆˆâˆ†_c c_Î±,Î³ Î³[122X, where
  [22Xâˆ†_c  =  âˆ†  âˆ©  Î¦_c[122X  and  the [22Xc_Î±,Î³[122X are non-negative integers. Now we take the
  Dynkin  diagram  corresponding  to  [22Xâˆ†[122X,  where the nodes corresponding to the
  compact  roots  are  painted  black,  and  the nodes corresponding to a pair
  [22XÎ±,Ï„(Î±)[122X,  if they are unequal, are joined by arrows. The resulting diagram is
  called  the  [13XSatake  diagram[113X  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X.  It  determines  the  real form
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X up to isomorphism.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YNilpotent orbits[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  [22XG^c[122X,  [22XG[122X  we  denote  the  adjoint  groups  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X and [22Xmathfrakg[122X
  respectively.  The  nilpotent [22XG^c[122X-orbits in [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X have been classified
  by  so-called weighted Dynkin diagrams. A nilpotent [22XG^c[122X-orbit in [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X
  may  have  no  intersection with the real form [22Xmathfrakg[122X. On the other hand,
  when  it  does  have  an  intersection,  then  this  may  split into several
  [22XG[122X-orbits.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet   [22Xe[122X  be  an  element  of  a  nilpotent  [22XG[122X-orbit  in  [22Xmathfrakg[122X.  By  the
  Jacobson-Morozov  theorem,  [22Xe[122X  lies  in an [22Xmathfraksl_2[122X-triple [22X(e,h,f)[122X; here
  this  means  that  [22X[h,e]=2e[122X,  [22X[h,f]=-2f[122X, and [22X[e,f]=h[122X. The triple is called a
  [13Xreal  Cayley  triple[113X  if  [22XÎ¸(e)  =  -f[122X, [22XÎ¸(f)=-e[122X and [22XÎ¸(h) = -h[122X, where [22XÎ¸[122X is the
  Cartan  involution  of [22Xmathfrakg[122X. Every nilpotent orbit has a representative
  lying in a real Cayley triple.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YOn base fields[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTo define a Lie algebra by a multiplication table over the reals, it usually
  suffices  to  take  a subfield of the real field as base field. However, the
  algorithms  contained  in  this package very often need a Chevalley basis of
  the  Lie  algebra  at  hand,  which  is defined only over the complex field.
  Computations  with  such a Chevalley basis take place behind the scenes, and
  the  result is again defined over the reals. However, the computations would
  not  be possible if the Lie algebra is just defined over (a subfield of) the
  reals.  For  this  reason,  we  require  that  the  base  field contains the
  imaginary unit [3XE(4)[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,  in  many  algorithms  it  is necessary to take square roots of
  elements  of  the  base  field.  So  the  ideal base field would contain the
  imaginary  unit, as well as being closed under taking square roots. However,
  such  a  field is difficult to construct and to work with on a computer. For
  this reason we have provided the field [3XSqrtField[103X containing the square roots
  of  all  rational  numbers. Mathematically, this is the field [22XQ^sqrt}(imath)[122X
  with   [22XQ^sqrt}=Q({sqrtpâˆ£   p   a   prime})[122X   and   [22Ximath=sqrt-1âˆˆC[122X.  Clearly,
  [22XQ^sqrt}(imath)[122X  is  an infinite extension of the rationals [22XQ[122X, and every [22Xf[122X in
  [22XQ^sqrt}(imath)[122X can be uniquely written as [22Xf=âˆ‘_j=1^m r_i sqrtk_j[122X for Gaussian
  rationals  [22Xr_iâˆˆQ(imath)[122X  and  pairwise distinct squarefree positive integers
  [22Xk_1,...,k_m[122X.  Thus, [22Xf[122X can be described efficiently by its coefficient vector
  [22X[[r_1,k_1],...,[r_j,k_j]][122X.    We    comment   on   our   implementation   of
  [22XQ^sqrt}(imath)[122X in Chapter [14X2[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAlthough  it is possible to try most functions of the package using the base
  field [3XCF(4)[103X, for example, it is likely that many computations will result in
  an  error,  because  of  the  lack  of square roots in that field. Many more
  computations  are possible over [3XSqrtField[103X, but also in that case, of course,
  a  computation  may  result  in  an  error  because  we  cannot  construct a
  particular  square  root.  Also,  computations  over  [3XSqrtField[103X  tend  to be
  significantly  slower  than over, say, [3XCF(4)[103X; see the next example. But that
  is  a  price  we  have  to  pay  (at  least,  in order to be able to do some
  computations).[133X
