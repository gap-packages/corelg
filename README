             ==============================================

CoReLG is a GAP4 package. Its main objective is to provide
functionality for computing with real (semi-)simple Lie algebras.

REMARK: this package is written for GAP4.4 (and higher versions);
        the package SLA is required.


                                Installation
             ==============================================


To install the package CoReLG move the file `corelg-XX.tar.gz'
(or any other archive containing it) into the `pkg' directory.
Usually this will be the `pkg' subdirectory in your GAP4 installation.
However, it is also possible to have a `pkg' subdirectory in a 
different place, see the section `Installing GAP Packages' of the 
GAP4 reference manual for more information.
Then simply unpack `corelg-XX.tar.gz' and your installation is
complete.
In GAP issue 

            gap> LoadPackage( "corelg" );


             
                                Documentation
             ==============================================

The manual of CoReLG is contained in /pkg/corelg/doc. The different 
versions of the manual (pdf, dvi, html) can be compiled by doing

           gap> corelg.makeManual( PATHDOC, PATHGAP );

where PATHDOC is the path to the /pkg/corelg/doc directory, and
PATHGAP is the path to the gap root directory.
