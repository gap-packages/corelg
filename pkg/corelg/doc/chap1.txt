  [33X[0;0Y[5XCoReLG[105X  (Computing with Real Lie Groups) is a [5XGAP[105X package for computing with
  (semi-)simple real Lie algebras. Various capabilities of the package have to
  do  with  the action of the adjoint group of a real Lie algebra (such as the
  nilpotent  orbits, and non-conjugate Cartan subalgebras). CoReLG is also the
  acronym of the EU funded Marie Curie project carried out by the first author
  of the package at the University of Trento.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  simple  real Lie algebras have been classified, and this classification
  is  the main theoretical tool that we use, as it determines the objects that
  we work with. In Section [14X1.1[114X we give a brief account of this classification.
  We  refer  to  the  standard  works in the literature (e.g., [Kna02]) for an
  in-depth  discussion. The algorithms of this package are described in [DG13]
  and [DFG13].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe remark that the package still is under development, and its functionality
  is continuously extended. The package [5XSLA[105X, [Gra12], is required.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.1 [33X[0;0YThe simple real Lie algebras[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  denote  a  complex  simple Lie algebra. Then there are two
  types   of   simple   real  Lie  algebras  associated  to  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X:  the
  [13Xrealification[113X  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  (this means that [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X is viewed as an
  algebra over [22XR[122X, of dimension [22X2dim mathfrakg^c[122X), and the [13Xreal forms[113X [22Xmathfrakg[122X
  of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X (this means that [22Xmathfrakg⊗_RC[122X is isomorphic to [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X).
  It  is  straightforward to construct the realification of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X; so in
  the rest of this section we concentrate on the real forms of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  Lie  algebra  is  said  to  be  [13Xcompact[113X  if  its Killing form is negative
  definite.   The  complex  Lie  algebra  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X  has  a  unique  (up  to
  isomorphism)  compact  real form [22Xmathfraku[122X. In the sequel we fix the compact
  form  [22Xmathfraku[122X. Then [22Xmathfrakg^c = mathfraku + imath mathfraku[122X, where [22Ximath[122X
  is  the  complex  unit;  so  we  get  an  antilinear  map  [22Xτ : mathfrakg^c->
  mathfrakg^c[122X  by  [22Xτ(x+  imath  y) = x- imath y[122X, where [22Xx,y∈ mathfraku[122X. This is
  called the [13Xconjugation[113X of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X with respect to [22Xmathfraku[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22Xθ[122X  be an automorphism of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X of order 2, commuting with [22Xτ[122X.
  Then  [22Xθ[122X  stabilises  [22Xmathfraku[122X,  so  the  latter  is the direct sum of the [22X±
  1[122X-eigenspaces  of  [22Xθ[122X,  say  [22Xmathfraku  =  mathfraku_1  ⊕  mathfraku_-1[122X.  Set
  [22Xmathfrakk  =  mathfraku_1[122X  and  [22Xmathfrakp  =  imathfraku_-1[122X.  Then [22Xmathfrakg
  =mathfrakg(θ)=  mathfrakk  ⊕  mathfrakp[122X  is  a  real  form  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.
  Regarding this construction we remark the following:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[22Xmathfrakg  = mathfrakk⊕ mathfrakp[122X is called a [13XCartan decomposition[113X. It
        is unique up to inner automorphisms of [22Xmathfrakg[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  map [22Xθ[122X is a [13XCartan involution[113X; it is the identity on [22Xmathfrakk[122X and
        acts as multiplication by [22X-1[122X on [22Xmathfrakp[122X)[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Y[22Xmathfrakk[122X  is  compact,  and  it  is  a  maximal compact subalgebra of
        [22Xmathfrakg[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YTwo  real forms are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding Cartan
        involutions are conjugate in the automorphism group of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe automorphism [22Xθ[122X is described by two pieces of data: a list of signs
        [22X(s_1,...,s_r)[122X  of  length  equal  to  the  rank  [22Xr[122X of [22Xmathfrakg[122X, and a
        permutation  [22Xπ[122X  of  [22X1,..., r[122X, leaving the list of signs invariant. Let
        [22Xα_1,..., α_r[122X denote the simple roots of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X with corresponding
        canonical generators [22Xx_i, y_i, h_i[122X. Then [22Xθ(x_i) = s_i x_π(i)[122X, [22Xθ(y_i) =
        s_i y_π(i)[122X, [22Xθ(h_i) = h_π(i)[122X.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.2 [33X[0;0YCartan subalgebras and more[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  be  a real form of the complex Lie algebra [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X, with
  Cartan  decomposition  [22Xmathfrakg = mathfrakk⊕ mathfrakp[122X. A Cartan subalgebra
  [22Xmathfrakh[122X   of   [22Xmathfrakg[122X   is   [13Xstandard[113X  (with  respect  to  this  Cartan
  decomposition) if [22Xmathfrakh = (mathfrakh∩ mathfrakk)⊕ (mathfrakh∩mathfrakp)[122X,
  or, equivalently, when [22Xmathfrakh[122X is stable under the Cartan involution [22Xθ[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  is  a  fact that every Cartan subalgebra of [22Xmathfrakg[122X is conjugate by an
  inner  automorphism to a standard one ([Kna02], Proposition 6.59). Moreover,
  there  is  a  finite number of non-conjugate (by inner automorphisms) Cartan
  subalgebras  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  ([Kna02],  Proposition  6.64). A standard Cartan
  subalgebra  [22Xmathfrakh[122X  is  said  to be [13Xmaximally compact[113X if the dimension of
  [22Xmathfrakh∩  mathfrakk[122X is maximal (among all standard Cartan subalgebras). It
  is  called [13Xmaximally non-compact[113X if the dimension of [22Xmathfrakh∩ mathfrakp[122X is
  maximal. We have that all maximally compact Cartan subalgebras are conjugate
  via  the  inner  automorphism  group.  The  same  holds  for  all  maximally
  non-compact Cartan subalgebras ([Kna02], Proposition 6.61).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  subspace  of  [22Xmathfrakp[122X is said to be a [13XCartan subspace[113X if it consists of
  commuting  elements. If [22Xmathfrakh[122X is a maximally non-compact standard Cartan
  subalgebra,  then [22Xmathfrakc = mathfrakh∩ mathfrakp[122X is a Cartan subspace. The
  other  Cartan subalgebras (i.e., representatives of the conjugacy classes of
  the   Cartan   subalgebras  under  the  inner  automorphism  group)  can  be
  constructed  such  that  their  intersection  with [22Xmathfrakp[122X is contained in
  [22Xmathfrakc[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEvery   standard   Cartan   subalgebra   [22Xmathfrakh[122X  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X  yields  a
  corresponding  root  system [22XΦ[122X of [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X. Let [22Xα∈Φ[122X, then a short argument
  shows  that  [22Xα∘θ[122X  (where  [22Xα∘θ (h) = α(θ(h))[122X for [22Xh∈ mathfrakh[122X) is also a root
  (i.e.,  lies  in  [22XΦ[122X). This way we get an automorphism of order 2 of the root
  system [22XΦ[122X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22Xmathfrakh[122X  be  a  maximally  compact standard Cartan subalgebra of
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X, with root system [22XΦ[122X. Then it can be shown that there is a basis of
  simple  roots  [22X∆⊂Φ[122X  which  is  [22Xθ[122X-stable.  Write  [22X∆  = {α_1,...,α_r}[122X, and let
  [22Xx_i,y_i,h_i[122X  be a corresponding set of canonical generators. Then there is a
  sequence  of  signs  [22X(s_1,...,s_r)[122X  and a permutation [22Xπ[122X of [22X1,...,r[122X such that
  [22Xθ(x_i) = s_i x_π(i)[122X. Now we encode this information in the Dynkin diagram of
  [22XΦ[122X.  If  [22Xs_i=-1[122X  then  we paint the node corresponding to [22Xα_i[122X black. Also, if
  [22Xπ(i)=j  ≠  i[122X  then  the  nodes corresponding to [22Xα_i[122X, [22Xα_j[122X are connected by an
  arrow.  The  resulting  diagram  is  called a [13XVogan diagram[113X of [22Xmathfrakg[122X. It
  determines  the real form [22Xmathfrakg[122X up to isomorphism. The signs [22Xs_i[122X are not
  uniquely  determined. However, it is possible to make a ``canonical'' choice
  for the signs so that the Vogan diagram is uniquely determined.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNow  let  [22Xmathfrakh[122X be a maximally non-compact standard Cartan subalgebra of
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X, with root system [22XΦ[122X. Then, in general, there is no basis of simple
  roots which is stable under [22Xθ[122X. However we can still define a diagram, in the
  following  way.  Let [22Xmathfrakc = mathfrakh∩ mathfrakp[122X be the Cartan subspace
  contained  in [22Xmathfrakh[122X. Let [22XΦ_c = { α∈ Φ ∣ α∘θ = α} = { α∈ Φ ∣ α(mathfrakc)
  =  0}[122X be the set of [13Xcompact roots [113X. Then there is a choice of positive roots
  [22XΦ^+[122X  such  that  [22Xα∘θ  ∈ Φ^-[122X for all [13Xnon-compact[113X positive roots [22Xα∈ Φ^+[122X. Let [22X∆[122X
  denote  the  basis  of  simple  roots corresponding to [22XΦ^+[122X. A theorem due to
  Satake  says  that  there  is a bijection [22Xτ : ∆-> ∆[122X such that [22Xτ(α) = α[122X if [22Xα∈
  Φ_c[122X,  and  for  non-compact [22Xα∈∆[122X we have [22Xα∘θ = -τ(α) - ∑_γ∈∆_c c_α,γ γ[122X, where
  [22X∆_c  =  ∆  ∩  Φ_c[122X  and  the [22Xc_α,γ[122X are non-negative integers. Now we take the
  Dynkin  diagram  corresponding  to  [22X∆[122X,  where the nodes corresponding to the
  compact  roots  are  painted  black,  and  the nodes corresponding to a pair
  [22Xα,τ(α)[122X,  if they are unequal, are joined by arrows. The resulting diagram is
  called  the  [13XSatake  diagram[113X  of  [22Xmathfrakg[122X.  It  determines  the  real form
  [22Xmathfrakg[122X up to isomorphism.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.3 [33X[0;0YNilpotent orbits[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YBy  [22XG^c[122X,  [22XG[122X  we  denote  the  adjoint  groups  of  [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X and [22Xmathfrakg[122X
  respectively.  The  nilpotent [22XG^c[122X-orbits in [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X have been classified
  by  so-called weighted Dynkin diagrams. A nilpotent [22XG^c[122X-orbit in [22Xmathfrakg^c[122X
  may  have  no  intersection with the real form [22Xmathfrakg[122X. On the other hand,
  when  it  does  have  an  intersection,  then  this  may  split into several
  [22XG[122X-orbits.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet   [22Xe[122X  be  an  element  of  a  nilpotent  [22XG[122X-orbit  in  [22Xmathfrakg[122X.  By  the
  Jacobson-Morozov  theorem,  [22Xe[122X  lies  in an [22Xmathfraksl_2[122X-triple [22X(e,h,f)[122X; here
  this  means  that  [22X[h,e]=2e[122X,  [22X[h,f]=-2f[122X, and [22X[e,f]=h[122X. The triple is called a
  [13Xreal  Cayley  triple[113X  if  [22Xθ(e)  =  -f[122X, [22Xθ(f)=-e[122X and [22Xθ(h) = -h[122X, where [22Xθ[122X is the
  Cartan  involution  of [22Xmathfrakg[122X. Every nilpotent orbit has a representative
  lying in a real Cayley triple.[133X
  
  
  [1X1.4 [33X[0;0YOn base fields[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order  to define a Lie algebra by a multiplication table over the reals,
  it  usually  suffices  to  take  a subfield of the real field as base field.
  However,  the  algorithms  contained  in  this  package  very  often  need a
  Chevalley  basis  of the Lie algebra at hand, which is defined only over the
  complex  field.  Computations  with such a Chevalley basis take place behind
  the  scenes,  and  the  result is again defined over the reals. However, the
  computations  would  not be possible if the Lie algebra is just defined over
  (a  subfield  of) the reals. For this reason, we require that the base field
  contains the imaginary unit [3XE(4)[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFurthermore,  in  many  algorithms  it  is necessary to take square roots of
  elements  of  the  base  field.  So  the  ideal base field would contain the
  imaginary  unit, as well as being closed under taking square roots. However,
  such  a  field is difficult to construct and to work with on a computer. For
  this reason we have provided the field [3XSqrtField[103X (see Chapter [14X2[114X), containing
  the  square  roots  of  all rational numbers. Although it is possible to try
  most functions of the package using the base field [3XCF(4)[103X, for example, it is
  likely  that  many computations will result in an error, because of the lack
  of  square  roots  in  that  field. Many more computations are possible over
  [3XSqrtField[103X,  but also in that case, of course, a computation may result in an
  error   because   we  cannot  construct  a  particular  square  root.  Also,
  computations  over [3XSqrtField[103X tend to be significantly slower than over, say,
  [3XCF(4)[103X;  see  the next example. But that is a price we have to pay (at least,
  in order to be able to do some computations).[133X
